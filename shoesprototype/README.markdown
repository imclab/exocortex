ExoCortex is an interface for a wearable computer. Specifically, I am designing
ExoCortex for a wearable platform consisting of a netbook running Linux, an iPod
Touch / iPhone for keyboard/mouse input (but mostly keyboard), and a Scalar
Corporation Teleglass T3-A head-mounted display (you can see it at
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krX4iTjqWDQ>).

Watch this space! The code is evolving quickly. Feel free to fork, if you'd
like to contribute, or just send me comments through GitHub. If you'd like to
work on becoming a cyborg or Gargoyle, contact me; we can meet up!
